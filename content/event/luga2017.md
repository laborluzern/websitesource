Am 1. Mai 2017 war das Labor Luzern wie jedes Jahr an der LUGA beim Stand von Infoklick.

Labor was building a serial network with Arduinos at the "Jugend die beste Generation"-exhibition. Our visualisation of how data is transmitted and saved on servers somewhere in the world on one hand and what people think the cloud is about on the other hand caused some nice discussions. Our magic smoke definitely brought love in the cloud.
